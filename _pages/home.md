I am a third year Ph.D student of Information Science at School of Informatics and Computing, Indiana University Bloomington. My advisor is Dr. [Xiaozhong Liu](http://scholarwiki.indiana.edu/homepage/index.html). I am interested in information retrieval, data mining, machine learning and complex network. Particularly, I am working on personalized community detection and real time recommendation tasks using scholarly data and social media data. My research is from both text mining view and graph mining view. For more details, please see my CV [here](files/paper1.pdf).
