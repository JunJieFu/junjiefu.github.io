I am a fourth year Ph.D student of Information Science at School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering, Indiana University Bloomington. My advisor is Dr. [Xiaozhong Liu](http://scholarwiki.indiana.edu/homepage/index.html). I am interested in leveraging **deep learning** methods to solve **information retrieval**, **recommendation**, **graph mining** and **natural language processing** tasks. Currently I am working as a research intern in DAMO Academy, Alibaba Group to develop cutting-edge models to support online scenarios. For more details, please see my CV [here](files/cv.pdf).
