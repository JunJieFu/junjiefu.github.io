<h2 id="research"> Research</h2>  

<small> Hi, I am Zheng Gao, a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate of [School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering (SICE)](https://sice.indiana.edu/) at [Indiana University Bloomington](https://www.indiana.edu/), USA, advised by Prof. [Xiaozhong Liu](http://xiaozhong.website2.me). My Ph.D. major is in Information Science and minor in Computer Science. I received my Master's degree in Information Science from [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/), USA and my Bachelor's degree in Information Science from [Shanghai International Studies University](http://en.shisu.edu.cn/), China.</small>  
<small>My research interests are primarily in the area of Graph Mining and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Particularly, I am applying deep learning techniques on the interdisciplinary field therein them to solve Community Detection, Information Retrieval and Recommendation related tasks.</small>
